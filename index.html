    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="image-1"><img src="image 1.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>As the title itself says that this blog is basically on Stock Market- The Future of Investment. So many of
      you would have listen to this term before "Stock Market" so<em> <strong>What is stock market? , How can we
          invest to earn money?</strong></em> All your queries and doubts will we resolved here. The main motive of
      this blog is to teach people about the Stock Market.
      <br>
      <br>
      Please read the blog carefully. So let's begin.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>What is Stock Market?</h4>
      <br>
      A <em><strong>stock market</strong></em> or <strong><em>share market</strong></em> is basically a collection or
      let’s say a market of buyers and sellers of shares which acts for <strong><em>ownership</strong></em> claims on
      businesses. This can be simply understood as buying some part of the whole.<br>
      A stock market is an exchange where brokers and traders can <strong><em>buy</strong></em> and
      <strong><em>sell</strong></em> shares or bonds. Many large companies have their stocks listed on the stock
      exchange (stock market). This makes the stock more eye catchy and thus more attractive to many investors. The
      exchange may also act as a mediator of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded "over the counter",
      that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in
      different countries, so as to attract international investors.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="image-2"><img src="image 2.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>Before starting I would like to clear some of the myths of stock market.
      <br>
      The myth of People is that the shock market is a gambling. Also people do fear to invest in shock market because
      they think that it’s very risky, requires a very good knowledge of finance.
      <br>
      <br>
      These statement are being heard many times when you will try to enter the stock market. But the reality is that
      if the investments are being made by doing some research and knowing the fundaments of the company it will
      surely give you high returns.
      <br>
      <br>
      Now the question arises that where can we buy the share. Is there anything that we can go to the company and buy
      the shares?
      The answer is absolutely NO.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>In India there are two major shock exchange or say shock market first is the BSE i.e. Bombay Stock
          Exchange and second is the NSE i.e. the National stock Exchange.</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="image-3"><img src="image 3.png" alt=""></div>
    <div><strong><em>BOMBEY STOCK EXCHANGE (BSE)</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      BSE is the oldest stock exchange of India which was established in 1875, it also the Asia's oldest stock
      exchange. The BSE is the world's 10th largest stock exchange. A more than 5500 companies have been listed in the
      BSE.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE OF INDIA (NSE)</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      NSE is now one of the <strong><em>leading stock exchange</strong></em> in India. It was been formed in the year
      <strong><em>1992</strong></em>. The reason of being India's leading stock exchange was to bring the
      revolutionary concept of dematerialization exchange with fully automatic and electronic trading system. A more
      than 1700 companies have been registered in NSE.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>What is the use of buying shares? or What is the benefit of buying shares ?</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Answer could be understood by a situation, why we invest your money? Answer is to multiple the investment. So
      where do we invest money in banks (FDs) mainly. At what rate do they give the interest..? Maybe at the rate of 5
      or 6 percent or max to max 7 percent. But in the case of Bull market the interest rate varies from 14 to 18
      percent. So I think the answer is petty much clear.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>Why do Stock Market has the bad name?</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now many of you may wonder that the stock market is giving enormous result in multiplying your money but why
      most of the people do not invest in stock market. Some of the main reasons are the scams that has happened in
      1986-1992 and 1998-2001 that shocked the whole market. These two incident took the whole trust of the people
      from the market. Secondly people who invest without doing the proper research of the company and bear the losses
      spread rumours in the society.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>How to invest in share market?</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      There are few things that you should know before you go to invest in stock market. People get high returns in
      stock market due to the effect of compounding. Before investing the investor should have a trading as well as a
      demat (dematerialised) account. Trading account for the management of cash and equity where as a demat account
      manages shares in a virtual form. And it is now a days very easy to open a demat account online. Now let's see
      the essential requirements for opening demat account online.
      <br>
      <br>
      Things required are:-
      <br>
      <br>
      Bank statement, Aadhaar card, PAN Card, A Broker (by whom all the transaction can be done).These all documents
      are basically for your identification and your income proof. After submitting these document within 10 days your
      demat account will be ready for use.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>Now let’s understand the stock trader</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Stock Traders are the people who trade equity securities. Their main goal is to buy and sell the shares of
      several different companies so as to gain profit for their clients.
      These traders plays an important role in the whole transaction to buying or selling the stock. Also they are the
      key person because they are the main source who provides liquidity.
